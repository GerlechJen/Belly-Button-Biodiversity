# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview

Rosa a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory wants to discover and document different bacteria species that are unknown to science. 
Improbable Beef, a food start up is partnering with her laboratory to research candidate bacterial species. They want bacteria that can synthesise proteins that have a perfect taste like beef. Rosa hypothesisis that bacteria found on human body specifically the belly button may be the ideal bacteria species to make synthetic beef.
She sampled navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonise their belly buttuns. The participantss identity has been kept anonymous and they have been assiged an id number instead. Each of these participants carries a variety of bacterial species in their belly button. 


With this data using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, attractive, accessible, and interactive data visualizations were created and deployed to the web. Buttons and drop down menus were included. The dashboard built displays the most common bacterial species, by count, in the navel and will be accessible to the research participants as well as fellow researchers. Once a participant enters his or her id number, they can determine which top 10 bacteria species live in their navel. This is a great way for them to better understand the data and draw conclusions.
